# SkewbSkills
Practice and learn skewb algs, first layer and more!

This file intends to show you how to use SkewbSkills.

# Installation
Take the zip.-file, unzip it and start the .exe. Do not move the .txt-files out of the directory, they contain the scrambles.
Using my pictures is not necessary, but they are included for design purposes. 

# Usage
## Starting Window
Choose any from the different practicing modes, by pressing the corresponding button or key, respectively. A new window appears, the
starting window closes. Note: the First Layer Trainer takes some time to open, so be a little patient.

## First Layer Trainer
Currently, the First Layer Trainer is pretty slow, so do not expect it to open immediately after you start it.
There's a slider to define the length of the scrambles, you can choose between 1 and 7 moves. If you want the scrambles to be 
shuffled, use the checkbox "Shuffle scrambles". The checkbox "Use all colours" allows SkewbSkills to show you various colours so that
you can practice to start the first layer with every color (to become CN). When you're ready with the customization, press
"Generate Scramble + Colour" (or Space). A new scramble appears, both as a label containing the scramble sequence, and with a drawing.
"Small warning": the more moves you select, the larger the files are that contain the scramble. Therefore, it might take a little until
the process is completed.

## L2L Alg Trainer
Select all the alg sets that you'd like to practice. SkewbSkills is going to shuffle (randomize) the order in which they appear.
Use the "Generate L2L Scramble" Button or press Return to generate a scramble. A drawing of the scramble appears. All scrambles are
performed with the White/Red/Green Corner on top/front. Start the timer with the "Start" Button or press Space. After starting the
timer, you can stop it again by clicking the same button ("Stop") or pressing Space again. You can than reset the timer to zero by
using the "Reset" button (or press "R").

## Your own algs
If you find that you'd like other scrambles to be displayed than the current ones, open any of the .txt-Docs and modify the
scrambles to your liking. If you want to keep track of which scrambles generate which case, see

(credits: Elias Malomgr√© and Carter Cucala). I use the same terms for the cases to indicate them, as well as the same order.
When modifying the scrambles in the .txt-Files, note that the very last character of the file must be one space in the line of the
last scramble. So do not make any additional line break after the last scramble, but end the line of the last scramble with a space.
In almost the same manner, do not use a space or anything else to end the previous scrambles. All lines that are not the last line
should only contain the scramble itself, ending with the last move.

I learned a lot from this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1FgJUcJJ03uO70zDLDF3oaTu6s2QLOPa
by Parwiz Forogh. I also used https://github.com/enkore/qt-stop-watch.py/blob/master/qt-stop-watch.py by enkore
to get the stopwatch running.
