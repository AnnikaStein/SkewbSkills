    Features:
        First Layer Trainer Dialog:
            Widgets:
                QSlider --> Scramble Length
                QPushButton --> generate a new scramble + colour to start with
                QLabel --> shows the scramble in monospace
                QLabel --> shows the colour to start with
                QLabel --> shows a logo
            Functionality:
                load all scrambles when program is started and keep them available
                    during the runtime of the program by using lists / containers
                    as constants throughout the whole execution
                decide how many moves the scramble shall consist of with a slider
                generate scrambles and all starting colours for this scramble
                scrambles are ordered (backwards)
                scrambles make sense and are not of the form x x' or x x
                when the end of all scrambles of a given length has been
                    reached, start all over again
                window title and icon are included
                favicon.ico has been generated online using
                    https://www.icoconverter.com/
                exe-File has been generated using the following cmd-line:
                    pyinstaller -w -F -i favicon.ico MainWindow.py
                    in venv\Scripts
                shortcut of the exe-File has been generated in the same folder
                    and has been attached to the taskbar
    py-Files:
        ScrambleGen.py (only to be used once, generates all possible
            scrambles with white or any colour to start with)
            no classes, no functions, no methods
        MainWindow.py (shows the dialog with all current Widgets)
            class Window(QDialog)
                def __init__(self)

    txt-Files:
        scrambles, scrambles1, scrambles1w, ... , scrambles7, scrambles7w
        (w indicates only white, other ones use all starting colours)

    Features:
        First Layer Trainer (central widget):
            New Widgets:
                QLabel --> shows copyright symbol and creators name
                QWidget --> centralWidget of QMainWindow, with gridlayout attached to it
                QCheckBox --> checks if scrambles shall be given out in random order or not
                QCheckBox --> checks if all colours shall be used as a starting colour

            Added Functionality:
                Font of groupBox changed to Sansserif, 13
                added label showing the creators name and copyright symbol
                added tooltip for the scramble length deciding slider, the button and
                    both checkboxes
                added shortcut (Qt.Key_Space) to the scramblegenbutton
                uses QMainWindow instead of QDialog for later purposes and puts
                    all previous widgets and the grid layout into self.central
                    and defines self.central as self.setCentralWidget
                added two checkboxes
                changed the functionality of the method changescrlen:
                    if self.shufflescrchecker is enabled, copy the list as always but shuffle it
                        before it is given back as self.scramblelist
                    if self.anycolourchecker is enabled, proceed as always, but if not, use the
                        scrambles with "w" in [filename].txt
                because cmd did not work properly with python installation, I used
                    pyinstaller -w -F -i favicon.ico MainWindow.py
                    in PyCharm local Terminal, now there is the latest exe-File in SkewbSkills\dist
                    the previous version has been stored in SkewbSkills\Version 1.0
                if you want to use the exe-File, make sure all files (png, txt, etc.) are
                    located in the same folder as the exe, otherwise, there will occur a
                    messagebox showing an error

    Features:
        First Layer Trainer (central widget):
            New Widgets:
                QWidget --> shows the scramble by drawing several polygons
            Added Functionality:
                clarified in tooltip of the shuffle-checkbox that shuffling might take some time
                defined a function threeswap that performs 3-cycles with elements of a list
                added class ScrambleDrawing (QWidget) that will show the scramble
                created a function ShowScramble in WindowFLT that uses the solved position /
                    index / sticker / colour - combination; splits the current scramble into moves;
                    performs permutations inside the list of colours / numbers and triggers the
                    ScrambleDrawing with the new (permuted) list; draws objects with specified
                    colour; now working correctly
                ScramblePlusColour triggers ShowScramble, which itself triggers the ScrambleDrawing
        Start Window Skewb Skills (central widget):
            New Widgets:
                QPushButton --> starts the FLT

                QPushButton --> starts the CS
                QPushButton --> starts the Q
                QLabel --> shows a logo
                QLabel --> shows info about the creator
            Added Functionality:
                added Start-Menu in which you can choose between several modes to practice
                buttons shown in Start-Menu can be triggered with shortcuts as well
                clicking one button of the Start-Menu closes itself and opens the corresponding
                    window with the desired functionality
